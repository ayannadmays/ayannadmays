## Hi there 👋

I am a graduate student currently using genetic and molecular techniques to investigate the evolutionary history and underpinnings of regeneration. I use cnidarians as model system. While my wetlab and molecular techniques are used in Hydra vulgaris, I use bioinformatic tools to investigate other cnidarian species in a comparative framework


I'm currently working on --- 🔭

✢ characterizing TE content and diversity in Medusozoan species
✢ characterizing TE activity in the regenerating Hydra


Some tools and platforms I use --- 🔧

  ✢ python
  ✢ BLAST
  ✢ RepeatModeler
